Dashboard Windows Application
==============================

Location: Dashboard.exe

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
This application requires .NET 9.0 Runtime to be installed on the target machine.

To install .NET 9.0 Runtime:
1. Download from: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0
2. Install the "Desktop Runtime" for Windows x64

HOW TO RUN:
-----------
1. Ensure .NET 9.0 Runtime is installed (see above)
2. Double-click Dashboard.exe
3. The application will launch

NOTE:
-----
This is a framework-dependent deployment. All DLL files in this folder must be kept together with Dashboard.exe.

If you need a self-contained version (that doesn't require .NET runtime installation), 
please contact the developer or rebuild with self-contained publish settings.
